As clinical testing of mpox virus (MPXV) declines, wastewater testing can be a useful 
approach to monitor the undetected MPXV transmission at community level. In this study, 
we report a prototype biosensing system for wastewater-based surveillance of mpox virus. 
We fabricated a DNA-modified electrode and employed CRISPR/Cas12a as a 
biocomponent for accurate recognition of viral DNA and subsequent cleavage of the 
reporter DNA immobilized on electrode surface to influence signal transduction. The data 
is collected through a cloud-supported system on smartphone and can be remotely accessed. 
For environmental sample detection, we used mpox pseudovirus to prepare simulated 
samples in river and sea waters to demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed system. 
The system can detect viral DNA down to pM level without target amplification. The 
biosensor demonstrated promising recoveries ranging from 85-103% when challenged 
with spiked environmental samples. Our internet of things-supported wastewater 
surveillance system takes mpox diagnostic to the next level where a single test could inform.
